This project was developed for the curricular unit Projeto de Desenvolvimento de Software, where the aim of this project was to develop a sales system (such as an inverted OLX). The buyer would post an ad regarding of what they wanted to buy and sellers would reach out to them. They would close the business and take care of the payment (money, MBWay, others).

#This project doesn't have all of its features implemented
